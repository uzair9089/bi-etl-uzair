WHEN NEW OBJECT HAS TO BE ADDED IN THE Redshift  ( For example events)

a. Every table which needs to be transferred into the redshift goes into the star schema in the DWH.
b. Data which can be transferred to redshift could reside in either table or a view as needed.
c. Every table that needs to be transferred into the redshift also needs to be created in the redshift in advance.

c. When a new table has to be moved to the redshift do the following:
    1. Create a view or a table to hold the data in the star schema
    2. In param.py add the table name to be transferred into the tbl_star list.
    3. Populate tbl_star_rename and tbl_star_truncate as required.

d. For pentaho tables do the same.

e. No need to change anything in runner.py, exporter.py and imported.py and uploader.py


f. etl_delta_load.py
    1. Add the new table into the entry with appropriate queries to be run (follow the already existing template and just copy pase with renaming the table name)


b. After all these changes are made, the changed code needs to be pushed to the server. Follow the instructions;
    1. git status
    2. git diff
    3. git add .
    4. git commit -m"test"
    5. git push

c. Log into the server of the etl and do the following process
    1. Issue the command "sudo su"
    2. Issue the command "source /opt/credential/pass.sh"
    3. go the the folder of the redshift and run "python runner.py star"



IMPORTANT:

1. Ensure that the table exists in both the star schema
