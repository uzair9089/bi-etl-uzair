WHEN NEW OBJECT HAS TO BE ADDED IN THE ABSENCE DATA ( For example reasons)

a.param.py
	1. Go to param.py file and add 'reasons' in tbl_absence list
	2. Add the 'reasons' in filter and then in filter_new lists
	3. Add in truncate queries list for the reasons
	4. If history data has to be loaded, provide the name of the object ( in our case 'reasons') in the history_object list in param.py


b.No need to change anything in the runner.py
c.No need to change anything in the exporter.py

d.importer.py
	1. Add the following piece of code

	 if self.collection_name == 'reasons.json':
	            print param.newpath + self.collection_name
	            if param.newpath + self.collection_name:
	                print param.newpath + self.collection_name
	                do = rp()
	                do.parser(self.collection_name)
	                print "finished parsing data for: " + self.collection_name



e. Create a parser and name it reasons_parser.py -->> create a parser here by taking an example from previous parsers available

f. Once the fields to be extracted from the 'reasons' object are known do the following steps.
	1. create table in the absence schema named 'reasons' with columns which are parsed from the parser
	2. create a staging table of the 'reasons' table. (create table stage.s_reasons_absence as select * from absence.reasons; alter table stage.s_reasons_absence add column rnk integer;)
	3. create view prod.reasons_absence as select * from stage.s_reasons_absence

g. Make an entry into the etl_delta_load.py file for the 'reasons' object by looking at other object examples already existing there.

h. parser.py
	1. change the table name to absence.reasons in the curs.execute statement.

i. After all these changes are made, the changed code needs to be pushed to the server. Follow the instructions;
	1. git status
	2. git diff
	3. git add .
	4. git commit -m"test"
	5. git push

ij Log into the server of the etl and do the following process
	1. Issue the command "sudo su"
	2. Issue the command "source /opt/credential/pass.sh"
	3. go the the folder of the absence and run "python runner.py absence"
